## Front End
As we have pack the frontend project and put it to the backend folder, if you are not interested in this section, you can skip here.
But if you want to explore more, you can continue.
Before you run the front end code, go to the backend project and start the server using docker, 
Then go to the folder where package.json is there, simply run 
```
npm install
```
This will install the depency file and after that, run
```
npm run dev
```
This will open the browser automatically and go to the page http://localhost:8080.
However, you will get CORS problem. This is because the browser has the protection. To solve that, install a browser plugin named "CORS". Remember to turn it off when you are done.
