week 1
Group formed. I joined the trello and bitbucket group. This week, we had another meeting on Friday afternoon and finished 90 percent of the proposal together. I wrote one part of the epic and one part of the aim and schedules. I did some researches on the Truffle and Web3j. We also exhanged our ideas of the blockchain.
